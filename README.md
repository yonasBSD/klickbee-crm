### 🧠 What is Klickbee CRM?

**Klickbee CRM** is an open-source CRM built entirely with **Next.js**. It centralizes customer management, sales
tracking, and internal collaboration in a modular, scalable structure.

Built for agencies, freelancers, and businesses who need clarity, sovereignty, and speed.

---

### 🧩 Architecture

Klickbee CRM follows a [**Feature-Driven Architecture (FDA)**](https://github.com/Klickbee/feature-driven-architecture) — each feature is self-contained with its own logic, UI,
and data layer.

```
src/
├── app/                     # Next.js App Router
├── components/              # Global components
├── feature/
│   ├── auth/                # Authentication (login, signup, etc.)
│   ├── companies/           # Company management (list, details, forms)
│   ├── customers/           # Customer management
│   ├── dashboard/           # Main dashboard and analytics
│   ├── deals/               # Deals and opportunities tracking
│   ├── meetings/            # Meetings and appointments
│   ├── prospects/           # Prospects and leads management
│   ├── settings/            # App and user settings
│   ├── todo/                # Task and to-do management
│   └── user/                # User management and profiles
├── libs/                    # Utility functions and shared logic
└── types/                   # Global TypeScript types

```

Each feature manages its own state, components, and API integrations. This approach ensures a **clear separation of
concerns**, making the app maintainable and scalable.
